    "Spark MLlib is excellent for handling data too large to fit into memory on a single machine.",
    "Keras makes neural network experimentation easy, but it's not optimized for distributed training.",
    "MLlib models can be serialized for Spark jobs, but deployment still favors ONNX or joblib formats.",
    "MLlib lacks online learning algorithms, unlike Vowpal Wabbit or River.",
    "When training models on petabyte-scale datasets, MLlib’s integration with HDFS is very helpful.",
